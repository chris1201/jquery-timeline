This jQuery plugin uses the Canvas drawing API introduced in HTML5 to render timeline widgets. The idea is to take some dull input data, such as a table of dates, and transform this into a rich, interactive element with minimal effort.

Features include:
 * Supports periods as well as events
 * Scale to years, decades, centuries, milliennia
 * Scroll by keyboard, mouse regions, custom events
 * Support for custom event handlers
 * Customisable appearance and style
